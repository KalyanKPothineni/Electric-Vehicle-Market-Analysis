# Electric and Alternative Fuel Charging Stations Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the placement and accessibility of electric and alternative fuel charging stations. Through data analysis and predictive modeling, the project aims to enhance user experience, support urban planning, and promote the adoption of eco-friendly vehicles. The analysis involves multiple milestones, including data selection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Selection and Preparation**: Initial selection and preprocessing of data, including feature extraction, transformation, and handling of missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, accessibility, and geographical patterns of charging stations.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building and evaluating a Linear Regression model to predict the number of Level 2 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) at charging stations.
- **Clustering**: Applying clustering techniques to identify geographical patterns in charging station placements.

## Project Structure

- `Electric and Alternative Fuel Charging Stations.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, visualizations, and model building in Python.
- `processed_charging_stations.csv`: A cleaned and processed dataset was used for analysis and modeling.
- `Milestone-1`: Folder containing scripts and results from the first milestone.
- `Milestone-2`: Folder containing scripts and results from the second milestone.
- `Milestone-3`: Folder containing scripts and results from the third milestone.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, geopy, etc.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes publicly available datasets from Kaggle containing detailed information on electric and alternative fuel charging stations.
